## Milestone Objective
Milestone 1 focuses on early pre-silicon validation using a **traditional (conventional) testbench**.
The goal is to validate:
- Basic RTL functionality
- Arbitration correctness
- Shared bus behavior
- Memory read/write dataflow

Generator-based processors are used instead of full CPU cores to simplify early system-level validation.
