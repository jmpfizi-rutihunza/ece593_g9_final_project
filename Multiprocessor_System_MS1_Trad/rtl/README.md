# RTL – Milestone 1

This directory contains the RTL implementation for Milestone 1.

## Description
- Generator-based processor models
- Centralized round-robin arbiter
- Shared bus interconnect
- Memory access logic (abstracted)

The RTL focuses on validating system-level behavior rather than full instruction execution.

## Files
- generator.sv
- mp_top.sv

## Notes
Cache and coherency logic are not implemented in Milestone 1 and will be added in later milestones.
